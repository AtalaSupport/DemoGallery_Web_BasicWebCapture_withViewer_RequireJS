## Prerequisites
### DotImage WingScan

### Visual Studio 2022 with .NET Framework 4.6.2 or above (but not .NET 5+)
This is a .NET Framework project. Since DotImage 11.5 supports .NET Framework 
4.6.2 as its minimum, this is the target. You can safely update it to higher  
.NET Framework versions (but not .NET 5+)

### IIS Express
This demo is set up using IIS Express (the built in web server in VS2022). 

#### Changing to Local IIS or deploying
You may alter it to run under a local copy of IIS, but if you do so you'll need 
to copy your licenses from

`c:\users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Local\Atalasoft\DotImage\11.5\`

into the bin directory of the application (next to the Atalasoft DLLs)
